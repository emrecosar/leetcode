Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation **00000000000000000000000000001011**, so the function should return 3.
